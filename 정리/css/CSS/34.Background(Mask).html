            <h2>Scroll Down and Watch What Happens</h2>
            <p>
                Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of
                having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was
                reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a
                book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'
            </p>
            <p>
                So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made
                her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy- chain
                would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a
                White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much
                out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
                late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to
                have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
                Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat- pocket, and looked at it, and
                then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
                had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take
                out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and
                fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
            </p>
            <p>
                In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world
                she was to get out again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped
                suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping
                herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time
                as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.
                First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too
                dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that
                they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and
                pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed;
                it was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty:
                she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it
                into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
            </p>
            <p>
                `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing
                of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say
                anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely
                true.)
